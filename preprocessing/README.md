#Data pre-processing

This folder contains the original data sources, and scripts tp preprocess the files (in some cases the preprocessed files are available)

The objective of preprocessing is to convert the data to a csv file with a proper encoding (UTF-8), translate column names when needed (Spanish to English) and to drop column that aren't useful for our analysis.
